# This is a HTTP Service taking JSON as input with a FLASK app.
Please prepare a skeleton web application, using any web server framework you like, preferably a lightweight one, e.g. express (node), flask (python), sinatra (ruby).

**Have a tool to send payloads to your server and inspect responses, for example cURL or HTTPie. No front-end client is required other than cURL or HTTPie to send test requests, it would be good to have a few example test requests ready to go before the interview. This will be a backend only exercise.**
